### Files

Filename | Description
--- | ---
`openapi/types.rs` | Data types used for REST requests and replies.
`client-rest/src/lib.rs` | Imports the REST types file to create the `svc-telemetry-client-rest` library, usable by other Rust crates.

### Endpoints

See the [Arrow API Documentation](https://www.arrowair.com/docs/category/apis) for specific request arguments.

| Endpoint | Type | Description |
| ---- | --- | ---- |
| `/health` | GET | 200 OK if all microservice dependencies are connected to this service.
| `/telemetry/adsb` | POST | Report a packet conforming to [ADS-B protocol](https://airmetar.main.jp/radio/ADS-B%20Decoding%20Guide.pdf).

### GRPC Server Methods ("Services")

GRPC server methods are called "services", an unfortunate name clash with the broader concept of web services.

| Service | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `IsReady` | Returns a message indicating if this service is ready for requests.<br>Similar to a health check, if a server is not "ready" it could be considered dead by the client making the request.

### GRPC Client Messages ("Requests")

This service does not have any unique requests.
